  spec.description = <<~DESC
    VebTree is a production-quality Van Emde Boas tree implementation providing 
    O(log log U) time complexity for insert, delete, search, successor, and 
    predecessor operations on integer sets. The core algorithm is implemented 
    in C++17 for maximum performance with an idiomatic Ruby API.
    
    Perfect for applications requiring fast integer set operations, range queries,
    and successor/predecessor lookups within a bounded universe.
